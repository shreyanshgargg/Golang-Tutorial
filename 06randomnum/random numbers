imagine you have a box full of colorful balls. Every time you reach in, you don't know which color ball you'll pull out—it’s a surprise! A random number is like pulling out a ball from that box without knowing which one it is.

In Go (a type of computer language), we can ask the computer to give us a random number, just like asking it to give us a random ball from the box. But before we ask, we have to make sure the computer knows how to choose a random number, so it doesn’t always pick the same one!

Here’s how we do it:

Get the box ready: First, we tell the computer to get the box ready, so it can pick a random number.

Ask for a number: We then ask the computer to give us a random number, just like pulling out a random ball.

Here’s how you tell the computer to do it in Go:

//code 
package main 

import "math/rand"
import "time"

func main() {
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())  // This makes the numbers different every time!
    randomNum := rand.Intn(10)        // This asks for a random number between 0 and 9
    fmt.Println(randomNum)            // Show the number you got!
}

rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano()): This is like getting the box ready to give us a different ball each time.
rand.Intn(10): This asks the computer to pick a number between 0 and 9 (just like picking a ball from the box).
fmt.Println(randomNum): This shows the ball (number) you got!
